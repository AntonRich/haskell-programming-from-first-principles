Given the list of import
```haskell
import qualified Control.Concurrent         as CC 
import qualified Control.Concurrent.MVar    as MV 
import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8      as B  
import qualified Data.Locator               as DL 
import qualified Data.Time.Clock.POSIX      as PSX
import qualified Filesystem                 as FS 
import qualified Filesystem.Path.CurrentOS  as FPC
import qualified Network.Info               as NI 
import qualified Safe                        
import Control.Exception (mask, try)         
import Control.Monad (forever, when)         
import Data.Bits                             
import Data.Bits.Bitwise (fromListBE)        
import Data.List.Split (chunksOf)            
import Database.Blacktip.Types               
import System.IO.Unsafe (unsafePerformIO)    
```

1. `forever` and `when` are imported from `Control.Monad`.

2. `Data.Bits` and `Database.Blacktip.Types` are both unqualified and imported in their entirety.

3. `Database.Blacktip.Types` probably defines a list of types for database operation.

4. Given moreover
```haskell
writeTimestamp :: MV.MVar ServerState
               -> FPC.FilePath
               -> IO CC.ThreadId
writeTimestamp s path = do
    CC.forkIO go
    where go = forever $ do
            ss <- MV.readMVar s
            mask $ \_ -> do
                FS.writeFile path (B.pack (show (ssTime ss)))
            -- sleep for 1 second
            CC.threadDelay 1000000
```
    a) `MV` refers to `Control.Concurrent.MVar`, `FPC` refers to `Filesystem.Path.CurrentOS`,
        and `CC` refers to `Control.Concurrent`.
    b) `FS.writeFile` refers to `import qualified Filesystem as FS`
    c) `forever` comes from `Control.Monad`.
