1. The cardinality of `data PugType = PugData` is 1.

2. The cardinality of 
```haskell
data Airline = PapuAir
             | CatapultsR'Us
             | TakeYourChancesUnited
```
is 3.

3. The cardinality of `Int16` is 65536.

4. For `Int`, we have
```haskell
maxBound :: Int = 2 ^ 63 - 1
minBound :: Int = - 2 ^ 63
```
whereas `Integer` is not bounded.

5. 2 ^ 8 = 256
